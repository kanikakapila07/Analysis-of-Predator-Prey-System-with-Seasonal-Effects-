# Analysis-of-Predator-Prey-System-with-Seasonal-Effects-
The dynamics between predator and prey populations is modeled using the Lotka- Volterra equations, a pair of first-order, non-linear, differential equations. These equations are a fundamental model for biological systems in which two species foxes (predators) and rabbits (preys) interact subject to seasonal variations. 
The dynamics of the predator-prey system considering seasonal effects are described by
the equations:
dx/dt = x(α − βy) + xγ sin(2πt) and
dy/dt = −y(δ − εx) + yζ cos(2πt)
where:
• x(t) and y(t) represent the prey (e.g., rabbits) and predator (e.g., foxes) populations
at time t, respectively.
• α, β, δ, and ε are coefficients that represent the interaction rates between the species
and their natural growth or decline.
• γ and ζ represent the amplitude of seasonal effects on prey and predator populations,
respectively.
• The terms involving sin(2πt) and cos(2πt) model the periodic nature of the seasons
throughout the year.
