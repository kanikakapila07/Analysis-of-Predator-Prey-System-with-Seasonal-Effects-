# Analysis-of-Predator-Prey-System-with-Seasonal-Effects-
The dynamics between predator and prey populations is modeled using the Lotka- Volterra equations, a pair of first-order, non-linear, differential equations. These equations are a fundamental model for biological systems in which two species foxes (predators) and rabbits (preys) interact subject to seasonal variations.
